## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#2962FF) to evoke the marina and water.
- Background color: Light blue (#E3F2FD), a very pale tint of the primary, to suggest clear, open skies and provide contrast with content.
- Accent color: Vibrant orange (#FFAB40) to draw attention to calls to action and important elements, since it offers a distinct contrast with the blues.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, providing both a modern and slightly warm, personable feel, well-suited for body text.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern serif with a high-end feel, suitable for headlines or small amounts of text, especially when paired with 'PT Sans' for body text.
- Use clean, line-based icons related to boats, restaurants, and navigation.
- Implement a responsive, mobile-first design that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
